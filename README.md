Rendered result can be seen in directory rendering_results.

HD images are rendered using 2500 SPP, 8 thread and max_ray_depth of 2.
The time is about an hour on my own machine(Mac).

Low quality images are rendered using 256 SPP, 8 thread and max_ray_depth of 4. 

Note: CBSpheres.png and CBSpheres_HD are rendered using light with emission (1,1,1) instead of (5,5,5). So the light may appear dimmer on the ball.
